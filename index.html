							<p>I am a <strong>freelance <a href="#intro-2" class="scrolly">digital conservator</a></strong> based near London. I specialise in the preservation of software-based art and work with those caring for it to research, develop and implement strategies for its long-term preservation.</p>

							<h2>üíø What is Digital Conservation?</h2>
							<p>Digital media is vulnerable to loss: hard drives fail, computer hardware becomes rapidly obsolete and file formats fall out of use. Maintaining access to artworks that depend on digital media requires an active approach of monitoring, assessment and intervention. To achieve this, a digital conservator works at the intersection of the traditions of cultural heritage conservation and digital preservation, applying their respective principles to caring for a variety of media types (e.g. video, software, web content) and the hardware required to access those media.</p>
							<p>I have a particular interest and expertise in the conservation of artworks with software and computer components. These can be used in a wide variety of ways by artists e.g. to generate moving images, to publish web content or to control other electronic equipment. With their basis in the live execution of computer code, and the host of technologies components needed to support this, such artworks pose various medium-specific conservation considerations that myself and colleagues in the conservation and preservation communities are working to address.</p>

							<h2>üéì Research and Teaching</h2>
							<h3>Research Interests</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Conservation and long-term preservation of time-based media artworks, particularly software-based artworks.</li>
								<li>Environment intervention as a conservation strategy e.g. disk imaging, emulation and virtualisation.</li> 
								<li>Analysis, documentation and reverse engineering of software objects and environments.</li>
								<li>Use of software as an artistic and creative medium, particularly real-time 3D rendering and game engine technologies.</li>
								<li>Approaches to creating documentation and sharing knowledge in support of time-based media conservation.</li>

							</ul>
							<h3>Teaching</h3>
							<p>I regularly teach courses and workshops on digital conservation, software-based art conservation and related topics, including disk imaging and emulation. For more information and availability, please get in touch using the details at the top of this page.</p>
							<h3>PhD Research</h3>
							<p>My PhD research explored documentation theory and practice in the conservation of software-based art. This research was the result of an AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Award between King's College London and Tate. The thesis was examined in November 2018 and passed with minor corrections. The thesis, titled <em>Technical Narratives: Analysis, Description and Representation in the Conservation of Software-based Art</em>, is <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/technical-narratives(e01bff94-08bd-4b83-aeef-4e7d6d5b0dfc).html">available online via the King's College London Research Portal</a>.</p>

							<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Practice</h2>
							<p>As a freelance digital conservator, I work with arts organisations and artists to: 
							<ul>
							<li>Apply conservation best practices to the care of digital and time-based media artworks, particularly software-based artworks.</li>
							<li>Retrieve data from contemporary, ageing and obsolete media (e.g. computers, optical discs, storage drives).</li>
							<li>Develop best practices, equipment and workflows to support the acquisition and treatment of digital and time-based artworks.</li>
							<li>Enhance the documentation and metadata created for digital and time-based artworks and their components.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I work regularly with Tate's Time-based Media Conservation team as a freelance acquisitions conservator and on two research projects, the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/projects/software-based-art-preservation">Software-based Art Preservation project</a> and the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/projects/preserving-immersive-media">Preserving Immersive Media project</a>.</p>
